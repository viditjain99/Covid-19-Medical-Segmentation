# Covid-19-Medical-Segmentation
The following tool uses semantic segmentation to segment patient lung CT scans to detect ground-glass, consolidaton and pleural effusion. We used a deep learning model U-SegNet to perform semantic segmentation. Ground-glass opacities have been shown to precede consolidations. Some reports have shown that early and more pronounced findings on CT correlate negatively with prognosis. Maybe volumetric and ratio of ground-glass/consolidation measurements can further enhance the prognosis estimation for Covid-19 patients.
